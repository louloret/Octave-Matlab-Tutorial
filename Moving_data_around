A = [1 2;
    3 4;
    5 6]

size(A) % tells you size of matrix

sz = size(A) % returns 1x2 matrix with dimensions of matrix
%3x2 in this case
size(A,1) %returns 1st dimension of A
% aka rows of matrix
% 3 in this case

size(A,2) %returns 2nd dimension of matrix 
% aka columns of matrix
%2 in this case

v = [1 2 3 4]

length(v) %returns length of vector aka 4

pwd %tells you working directory

help cd %allows you to set working directory

ls % list directories on your server/desktop

load featuresX.dat %loads features X in data
%can also do load('featuresX.dat')

load priceY.dat %loads dependent variable in data

who % tells you your variables in workspace

size(featuresX)
size(priceY)

whos % gives you detailed view of variables in workspace, with size
%and data type

clear featuresX %gets rid of featuresX variable

v = priceY(1:10) %first 10 elements of y
